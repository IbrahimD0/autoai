**AutoAI: AI Automation Platform \- Revised MVP  Implementation Plan** 

✅ **Feasibility Assessment: Website Generation Solutions** 

**Option 1: Template-Based with AI Enhancement (RECOMMENDED)** 

• Use pre-built chocolate shop templates (we’ll start with chocolate shops then move on to other  industries like food, veterinary, other places) from platforms like Hostinger, or 10Web\[5\]\[6\]\[7\]\[8\] 

• AI extracts menu data and auto-populates template content 

• 5-minute setup achievable\[9\]\[10\]\[11\] 

• **Pros**: Fast, reliable, professional results 

• **Cons**: Limited to template variations 

**Option 2: iframe Integration Approach (POSSIBLE BUT LIMITED)** • Embed existing website builders like Wix AI or Hostinger AI within your platform\[12\]\[13\]\[14\] • User stays on your domain but uses embedded builder 

• **Pros**: Seamless user experience 

• **Cons**: Limited customization, potential iframe restrictions\[15\]\[13\] 

❌ **Bolt.new Integration: NOT FEASIBLE** 

Research shows bolt.new doesn't offer: 

• Public API for embedding\[16\]\[1\]\[17\] 

• White-label or iframe solutions 

• Integration capabilities for external platforms 

• The bolt.new experience cannot be replicated within your site 

**Business Focus: Chocolate Shops Only (MVP)** 

**Market Opportunity:** 

• Target market of 3,000+ chocolate shops in the US\[5\]\[6\]  
• 77% of small businesses struggle with technology adoption\[6\] • Average shop can save $50K+ annually in labor costs • $720K addressable market at $20/month per shop
